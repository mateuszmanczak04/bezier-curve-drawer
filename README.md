**How to run**

`npm run typescript` to compile `.ts` code in real time.

`npm run server` to run localhost with app preview in the browser.

Suggest to run two scripts in parallel in two separate terminals.

**Important files**

`src/app.ts` - main app file with all functionalities

`index.html` - html structure for the app

`build/*.*` - don't touch, these are just results of compiled typescript files

`.prettierrc` - config file for code formatter

`style.css` - style definition file
